## Introduction
A/B testing is a powerful method for evaluating the impact of changes in user experience, product features, or marketing strategies. This project applies Python-based data analysis to determine the performance of two ads, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

---

## Features
- **Data Import and Cleaning**: Load, inspect, and prepare datasets for analysis.
- **Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed the data sets to answer multiple questions
---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy

---

## Data Analysis Process
1. **Import and Inspect Data**: 
   - Load datasets and check for missing values or inconsistencies.
   - Merge relevant data for seamless analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summarize key metrics such as click-through rates and conversion rates.
4. **Interpretation**:
   - Analyze results to draw meaningful conclusions about ad effectiveness.

---

## Results
Key findings will highlight:
- Which ad performed better.
- Practical recommendations for optimizing ad strategies.

---

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourblessingitodo/A-B-Testing.git
   cd ad-ab-test
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pythonabtest.ipynb
   ```

---

## Future Work
- Perform statistical analysis to assess the significance of the differences
- Extend analysis to include multiple test groups or more ad features.
- Automate A/B testing pipelines for real-time data analysis.
- Integrate advanced statistical or machine learning techniques to refine results.
